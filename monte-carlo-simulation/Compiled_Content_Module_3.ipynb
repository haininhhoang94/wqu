    "Risk is everywhere and, if you let it, has the potential to destroy a business. This is particularly the case in the financial sector where markets can move in unpredictable and unexpected ways. So, being able to manage risk is a very important skill for any individual in business, and even more so in the financial sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, managing risk is more than sitting in a room and brainstorming what can go wrong. In order to truly manage it, we need techniques which allow us to introduce a degree of objectivity and consistency when identifying and quantifying the risk that the business or a project faces. The aim of this module will be to expose you to two popular methods for quantifying risk: Value at Risk (VaR) and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA).\n"

    "A few examples of potential risk metrics include volatility (or variance) and correlation. These give an idea of the extent to which your portfolio's value could decrease, and how susceptible it is to massive swings in value. However, in order for them to fully characterize the risk inherent in the portfolio, you would need the distribution of returns to be multivariate normal, which is very unlikely. Thus, we would need to use a more general metric: Value at Risk."

This can be measured in absolute terms (we could lose $100 in portfolio value) or in relative terms (the value of our portfolio will decrease by 5%). Because of the possible usefulness of both measures, we will present both potential definitions (although they are linked regardless).\n",

The historical simulation parts are a bit more involved. The nested loop is necessary to generate a distribution for the future portfolio values through the historical simulation method.

    "Up until this point, we have been running our Monte Carlo simulations within a Black-Scholes framework. This has been useful because of the ease with which we can implement it; however, it does rely on some unrealistic assumptions. One of these is that there is no risk of default. In this set of notes, we will introduce the concept of credit risk, and give an overview of how it can be accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions\n",
    "When contracts are traded on an exchange, the exchange itself takes responsibility for ensuring that the parties receive the payments they are due. This is not the case for over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. For example, suppose you entered into an agreement for a company to buy an asset from you at some point in the future. If this company were to become bankrupt, you would miss out on any profit you were entitled to. This danger is known as counterparty credit risk. It is also often called default risk. We will use these two terms interchangeably. It is important to note that counterparty risk is faced by both parties in any transaction. In our above example, you could have insufficient funds to buy the asset to sell it to the company – in this case, they could lose out on profit. Since both parties are exposed to default risk, it is bilateral.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now introduce a concept known as exposure. Your exposure at any time t is what you are at risk of losing, were the counterparty to default. It is the higher of the value of the portfolio and 0, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(t) = max(V(t), 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it this way: if your portfolio has a negative value (meaning you would owe the other party money), and they default, you don't lose out on any profit. If the value of the portfolio was positive and they defaulted, you would lose the value of the portfolio (the amount they owed you).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of further concepts which follow on from exposure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current exposure, which is the exposure when 𝑡 is the current time,\n",
    "- Expected exposure, which is what you predict the exposure to be at a future time 𝑡,\n",
    "- Potential future exposure, which confidence level on exposure at some future time (this is very similar in concept to Value at Risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "With these ideas of counterparty risk and exposure, we can now define credit valuation adjustments (CVA). CVA is calculated as the difference between the value of a portfolio which we assume is risk-free, and a portfolio where we account for default risk. As such, CVA can be thought of as the market value of the counterparty credit risk. As you might expect, the higher your exposure, the higher your CVA, since you stand to lose more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a mathematical definition of counterparty risk, we need to define two variables: $\\delta$ and $\\tau$. $\\delta$ will be our recovery rate - this is the fraction of our portfolio that we would receive if the counterparty defaults. In other words, if our portfolio is worth V(t) at time t and the counterparty defaults at time t, we would only receive $\\delta$V(t). So, we would lose (1 - $\\delta$)V(t). Our second variable, $\\tau$, is a stopping time. This will be the time that the counterparty defaults. If the counterparty never defaults, $\\tau = \\infty$. We only lose out if the counterparty defaults before the time we close-out our position with them. Our CVA is thus as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CVA = \\mathbb{E}^\\mathbb{Q}[𝑒^{−r\\tauτ}(1 - \\delta)V(\\tau)\\mathbb{I}_{(\\tau \\leq T)}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where r is our risk-free interest rate and 𝑇 is the close-out time for our portfolio. Let's go through each element in this expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{E}^\\mathbb{Q}$: we are calculated our expectation under the risk-neutral measure, as we always do for pricing.\n",
    "- $e^{−r\\tau}$: we are discounting our value to the present time.\n",
    "- $1 - \\delta$: this is the proportion of our portfolio that we lose if there is a default.\n",
    "- $V(\\tau)$: this is how much our portfolio is worth in total at the time of default\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{I}_{(\\tau \\leq T)}$: we only lose out if the counterparty defaults before we have closed-out our position with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest issue we face with CVA is the difficulty in calculating it, as there are a number of factors which affect it, such as credit spreads and market factors. As a result, we introduce an extension to the Black-Scholes model, known as the Merton model."
