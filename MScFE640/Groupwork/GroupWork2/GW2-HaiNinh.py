# Using the data that you calculated in Submission 1, complete the following tasks (use the data
# in the "GWP_PTAP_Data.xlsx" spreadsheet provided in the course room):

# 1. Calculate and draw a scatter plot graph of the efficient frontier based on 11 combinations
# of XLE and XLI
# - Portfolio 1 = 100% XLE + 0% XLI
# - Portfolio 2 = 90% XLE + 10% XLI
# - .....
# - Portfolio 11 = 0% XLE + 100% XLI

# 2. Select a portfolio from portfolios 1-11 on the efficient frontier that satisfies the following
# constrants:
    # - The return is greater than 9.43%
    # - The volatility is not greater than 16.8%

# 3. Comment on how the portfolio selected in Submission 2(b) is expected to perform relative

    # - Return
    # - Risk
    # - Risk-adjusted return, including the Sharpe Ratio

# 4. Comment on the appropriateness of the S&P 500 as a benchmark for the portfolio.
